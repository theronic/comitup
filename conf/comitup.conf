# hotspot, and enabled when there is a normal wifi connection.
#
# web_service: httpd.service

# enable_appliance_mode
#
# If enabled (true), and if two wifi adapters are available, comitup will
# maintain the comitup-<nnn> hotspot on the first, and make other AP
# connections on the second. IP forwarding and NAT are enabled, so that
# hosts on the comitup hotspot will be able to access external networks.
#
# enable_appliance_mode: true

# include a single argument, either 'HOTSPOT', 'CONNECTING', or

# owning user.
